# Coding Challenge App

A skeleton flask app to use for a coding challenge.

## Install:

You can use a virtual environment (conda, venv, etc):
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate user-profiles
```

Or just pip install from the requirements file
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
There may also be a need to pip3 install requests
```

## Running the code

### Spin up the service

```
# start up local server
python -m run 
```

### Making Requests

```
curl -i "http://127.0.0.1:5000/getStats/<repo or org name>"
```
